# Conclusion by Aaron

World War II left a lasting imprint on global gender roles, permanently reshaping societal norms. While some countries reverted to traditional expectations after the war, the cracks in these structures were undeniable. Women’s contributions—whether in combat, factories, or humanitarian efforts—proved their capabilities and challenged long-standing assumptions about their roles. The war didn’t just create temporary changes; it set the stage for future movements toward gender equality. By forcing nations to rely on women in unprecedented ways, World War II laid the foundation for the societal shifts that would define the decades to come.
