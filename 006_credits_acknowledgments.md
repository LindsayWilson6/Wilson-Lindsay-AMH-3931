# Credits and Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Professor Goodwin for this new skill we have learned this semester and the ability to go into future historical endeavors with the knowledge of how to use technology to better study and publicize history. We would also like to acknowledge the Github site for having detailed instructions that made this assignment a little bit easier.
