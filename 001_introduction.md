Before World War II, the UK, USSR, Germany, and Japan each approached gender roles based on their cultural and ideological foundations. In the UK, women were mostly seen as caretakers and homemakers, though the suffrage movement had started giving them a foothold in public life. The USSR pushed for gender equality in theory, getting women into the workforce and involved in building the state, but old patriarchal ideas still hung around. Germany’s Nazi regime idealized women as mothers protecting Aryan purity, discouraging them from stepping outside traditional domestic roles. Rooted in Confucian values, Japan emphasized women’s duty to the family, focusing on obedience and domestic responsibilities. These ideas set the groundwork for women’s roles during the war.
When the war hit, countries had to rethink gender roles to handle the demands of full-scale mobilization. Governments needed women to fill in for men who left to fight, whether in factories, agriculture, or other critical jobs. Even neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden had to adapt, relying more on women for labor and humanitarian work. This study examines how these shifts happened and how different countries balanced practical needs with cultural traditions during the war.
The analysis focuses on three areas: workforce participation, military roles, and the influence of propaganda. Women stepped into roles they wouldn’t have touched before the war, working in industries and agriculture to keep things running. In the UK, organizations like the Women’s Land Army kept farms productive, while in the USSR, women worked in factories and joined combat units. Propaganda played a significant role in shaping how people viewed these changes. Germany and Japan used it to keep women focused on traditional roles, while Allied countries leaned into messaging that framed women’s contributions as essential to the war effort.
World War II forced nations to rethink traditional gender roles, but how they approached these changes varied widely. The USSR, driven by its communist ideology, placed women in combat and industrial jobs, while Germany and Japan leaned on propaganda to keep women in traditional domestic roles. The UK saw women stepping into factories and fields, balancing societal norms with the practical need for labor. Even neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden felt the pressure, with women filling workforce gaps and leading humanitarian efforts. This study looks at these different approaches to understand how cultural and political beliefs shaped women’s roles during the war and asks whether these changes were temporary or left a lasting impact on society.
The study also asks important questions about these changes. How much did cultural and political beliefs shape a country’s response to shifting gender roles? Did the war change things for good, or did societies just snap back to old norms when it ended? And how did these shifts differ between countries actively fighting the war and those sitting on the sidelines? By digging into these questions, this project aims to figure out what World War II meant for gender roles and whether it led to any lasting changes or just temporary adjustments.
