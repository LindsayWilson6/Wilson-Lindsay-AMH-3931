Before World War II, the UK, USSR, Germany, and Japan each approached gender roles based on their cultural and ideological foundations. In the UK, women were mostly seen as caretakers and homemakers, though the suffrage movement had started giving them a foothold in public life. The USSR pushed for gender equality in theory, getting women into the workforce and involved in building the state, but old patriarchal ideas still hung around.
